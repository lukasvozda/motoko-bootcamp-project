## DFINI∞SHIELDS motoko-bootcamp 2022 project

See the live version here: https://l53cn-iiaaa-aaaah-qcwia-cai.ic0.app

DFINI∞SHIELDS is a project developed during the event of the Motoko Bootcamp 2022 run by Dfinity Community.

You can use the token faucet to get free tokens and mint your unique NFT. Yeach color can bu used only once so nobody can have the same NFT really.

The whole work was done under quite a time pressure as I am working full time and was working on this in the evening, so please be respectfull if you see some bugs or very lame coding :D
