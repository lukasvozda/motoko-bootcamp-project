<h1>About</h1>
<p>DFINI∞SHIELDS is a project developed during the event of the Motoko Bootcamp 2022 run by Dfinity Community.</p>
<p>You can use the token faucet to get free tokens and mint your unique NFT. Yeach color can be used only once so nobody can have the same NFT really.</p>
<p>The whole work was done under quite a time pressure as I am working full time and was working on this in the evening, so please be respectfull if you see some bugs or very lame coding :D</p>
